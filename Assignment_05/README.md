# What is Data Analysis
## A process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.
# Data Analysis Tools
* Auto-managed closed tools : Tablue, Qlikq, looker....
* Programming Languages : Python, R, Julia
# Why Python for Data Analysis?
## very simple and intuitive to learn, “correct” language, powerful libraries (not just for Data Analysis), free and open source, amazing community, docs and conferences
# The Data Analysis Process
## Data Extraction, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Analysis, Action
# Common libraries we use...
* pandas: The cornerstone of our Data Analysis job with Python
* matplotlib: The foundational library for visualizations. Other libraries we’ll use will be built on top of matplotlib.
* numpy: The numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in Python.
* seaborn: A statistical visualization tool built on top of matplotlib.
* statsmodels: A library with many advanced statistical functions.
* scipy: Advanced scientific computing, including functions for optimization, linear algebra, image processing and much more.
* scikit-learn: The most popular machine learning library for Python (not deep learning)
