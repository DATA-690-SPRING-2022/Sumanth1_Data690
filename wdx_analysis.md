# Energy and Mining

### Mining is first and foremost a source of mineral commodities that all countries find essential for maintaining and improving their standards of living. Mined materials are needed to construct roads and hospitals, to build automobiles and houses, to make computers and satellites, to generate electricity, and to provide the many other goods and services that consumers enjoy.

# Why is it important to you and/or to others?
* Electricity is an essential part of modern life and important to the country economy. People use electricity for lighting, heating, cooling, and refrigeration and for operating appliances, computers, electronics, machinery, and public transportation systems.
* I would like to give the breif description of energy and mining including how much eletricity is used, how much of poulation is using eletricity and total production of eletricity.

# Outlook 
### To look at usage of eletricity across the world, we'll use World Development Explorer (worlddev.xyz). Below are the countries with the highest and lowest access to eletricity, based on 2016 World Bank data
